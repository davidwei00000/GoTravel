# GoTravel
This is the project for CSE 355. 
I developed an IOS App in this project, combined with Core Data and RESTful API.
This project has two main functions: Find a new city and View my Favorites. User can search their destinations in the first function, they can also get some information like latitude, longitude, recent temperature and satellite map of it. This part would be performed through some Web APIs. In the second function, users will be allowed to save the city to their list and choose pictures for the city either from camera of from photo library.


Project Idea:
Many people like travelling and want to travel. Before travelling, they may experience a long period of time to decide their vacation destination. This process may take them great efforts and time. My main idea is to develop an APP to help the users find their vacation destination. Typically, users can use this APP to search some information about their vacation destination, and the APP will then show some basic details like image, description and its location with related to Google Maps. In this process, some related API about Google Map will be called to perform this function. Besides, my APP will use the core data to let users store their search results in a table view so that they can check their search results in a list and finally find their dream destination. Displaying in a list will make the result very clear and direct which is helpful to make decisions. I believe my APP will help the users to decide on their vacation destination and improve their experience.

The Pre slides and codes will also be provided.
